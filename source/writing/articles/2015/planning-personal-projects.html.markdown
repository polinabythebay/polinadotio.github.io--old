Working on personal projects is helpful for building up your skillset, trying out new technologies, getting your foot in the door, and enjoying life as a developer. However, if you haven't worked as a freelancer or a contractor before it might not be obvious what you need to plan out a successful side project. I'm going to cover a process I've used to keep myself on track and finish projects. The first step I think is the hardest if you are not familiar with the technology you're using or with web development.

1. Define requirements and write user stories

2. Create mockups, wireframes, and sketches

3. Write out the TDD specs, implement the feature, and test each user story.
