This is my syllabus for a self-taught course I created for myself to learn Ruby on Rails. Feel free to take inspiration from it and implement your own courses.

##Objective 
[Return to top](#return)

My goal is to gain competency and knowledge of best practices in web development by learning and implementing a web development framework. However, it can take hours, days, and weeks to become proficient in the best practices of a specific framework even for experienced developers. This is why I'm designing an independent study where I can devote time to doing so. Why do I want to teach myself Rails specifically? A few reasons: 

* Ruby on Rails is an open-source web framework based on the Ruby programming language. 
* Rails is a database-agnostic MVC framework that chooses convention over configuration, which means that it's strongly opinionated when it comes to architectural decisions, naming conventions, paths and patterns.
* Rails is a full stack web application: it includes libraries to manage frontend code, supports SASS and CoffeeScript, and does not need an external tool to manage compiling. It also includes a very opinionated workflow. 
* Railsâ€™ structure makes it easy to accommodate change. Rails is particularly good at restructuring your application flow, reusing components in a simple way.
* Rails can easily be extended with a wide variety of external libraries, distributed through Rubygems. 
It implements other best practices and methodologies in web development: TDD, REST, and DRY are among them. 

To summarize, Rails is a powerful web development framework that lets you be more productive when working on complex projects.
