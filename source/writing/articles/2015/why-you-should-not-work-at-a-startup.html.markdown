title: Why you should not work at a startup

[Full disclosure: I currently work at a startup. These are my misfortunes.]

After a year of working at a startup in SOMA (SF's enclave of startups south of Market St.) I do take issue with the culture and the barriers for women like me who want to navigate their career and be really awesome software developers and talk about systems programming all day and who don't really want to leave tech. 

I have thought about leaving tech for the following reasons. :( These also happen to be reasons why you shouldn't work for a startup:

#### 1. Bad Managers: the glass ceiling is made of bad managers

It's all too common for folks not cut out for management to be in managerial roles. They might be engineers who are promoted to management without any kind of training, or they might be that guy that was promoted because a spot needed to be filled (such is life in startup land). 

As a result, you have bright engineers as awful managers in rapidly growing companies where existing leadership is already spread thin. These new managers haven't spent time thinking about unconscious bias, HR related topics, performance reviews, interviewing. While I think all employees would benefit from new managers receiving training, mentorship, and supervision, I think untrained and unsupervised managers cause more harm to women than men. On several occassions managers of mine have made me feel unwelcome in a machismo culture; isolated rather than supported; and presented me with an opaque career path due to lack of mentorship, or no career path at all. 

This translates into having less folks advocate for me. I've felt stereotype threat based on a refusal to give any positive feedback. It's been translated into feedback only when I'm doing something wrong in a hyper competitive (not so collaborative) office culture. My experience thus far with bad managers has led me to want to leave the industry. Not because I don't love programming, but because it's become toxic and mentally taxing.

#### 2. No formalized hiring/interiew process

Organizations that formalize hiring will reduce bias. If there's a haphazard approach to hiring, there is no way of truly knowing how often unconscious bias play a large role in decision making.

Interviewing for startups in the Bay Area is its own kind of awful. You have people who do not know how to interview, recruiters who do not know what they're looking for, and hiring managers and interviewers who either do not know what they want, or want different things. Add unconscious bias on top of that, and it becomes a matter of finding more coworkers like the ones you already work with in your white male fratty startup.

#### 3. No formalized review process/promotion criteria

The startup I'm at currently does not have a formal preformance review process. Let me reiterate: I have not had a performance review since I've been at this startup. 

One of my managers has talked for months about instituting some sort of review process for my work but has said "all of the current processes don't work anyways so why bother". That means I have to rely on self-nominations and self-evaluations and aggressively approach my managers for promotions. Relying on people nominating themselves hurts women, who often are less likely to put themselves forward. Relying on self evaluations in performance scoring is also not helpful. Not having actual review cycles also means it's sometimes impossible to get a promotion even if you do stick yourself out there and demand one. It makes me feel boxed in and creates a dead end professionally.

#### Summary

Not all startups have this issue, but most startups will have some or all of these issues. The best thing to do is to figure out your exit strategy from that startup and do a lot of research. Join women in tech groups on Facebook and ask women at other companies out for coffee. Ask them these questions. Do not end up with a bad manager! You will not have a good time. Instead try to find a company that cares more about its employees, especially its women. It'll definitely be worth it. :) And please do not leave tech! I commiserate with you and I support you. You are not alone <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>.
