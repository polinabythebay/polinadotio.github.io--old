I recently did a sprint using D3.js to make several visualizations. I was wondering how often I should be a scribe and how often I should think of myself as a conjurer.

###D3 uses a general update pattern-- there is some weird voodoo stuff going on here.

Using D3.js is an experiential sort of learning.

The Conjurer uses their intuition to ignore all the complexity that may arise and only focus on the parts that are important for getting their job done. Their power lies in sifting through all the noise and focusing on the heart of the matter. This does seem like magic and look like magic.

The scribe researches documentation and tries to understand things under the hood. The conjurer trusts their instincts. I'm going to try to have these two approaches when learning D3.

- instances under the hood that I meticulously learned

- high level patterns where I'm trusting my intuition
