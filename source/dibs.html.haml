        / %h4 Project Background
        / %p
        /   Founded in 2007, Nixle connects citizens with alerts from their government agencies such as firefighters and police officers. In an effort to expand their product to broadly connect agencies, citizens, and schools altogether, the Nixle team came to <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> to pursue this vision.
        / %p
        /   As the lead product designer on this project, I worked through the
        /   entire project lifecycle for the MVP launch in November 2014. I would
        /   be responsible for identifying the customers' goals to prototyping to
        /   building out features that shipped. Thus, it was imperative for me to
        /   conduct the product discovery, grasping Nixle's existing product,
        /   business, technology, and customer. I led a week-long design sprint
        /   with the stakeholders, addressing how to define a product that
        /   addresses customers' needs within the various constraints we had.
        / %p
        /   Our goal was to build an MVP in web and iOS platforms to provide the
        /   services to the customers.
