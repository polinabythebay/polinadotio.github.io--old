    %p I graduated from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lAQVF5Sy3A">Wellesley College</a> with a degree in <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/cs">Computer Science</a>.

    %p I'm proud to call the Castro neighborhood my home. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to podcasts, running, and learning about the world and people through stories.

      If you would like to hang out or talk about working together, you can
