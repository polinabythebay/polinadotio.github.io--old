        Hi there! My name is Polina, and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a>. I'm incredibly passionate about building for the web-- software engineering is a means through which I can be proud of building a service that empowers those around me.

    %p In my free time I enjoy attending and mentoring at hackathons, learning new frameworks and languages, and tackling meaningful projects. One such project I'm proud of is <a href="https://github.com/httparty" target="_blank">MatchJS</a>, a mentorship platform for JavaScript developers. The project idea grew out of our teamâ€™s shared interest in continuing to learn and grow as engineers, while helping others to do the same. 

    %p I graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/cs" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and currently reside in San Francisco. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to podcasts, running, and learning about the world and people through stories.
