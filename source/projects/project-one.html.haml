        %h2 Making my Portfolio
        %p I have gone through several iterations of my personal site (6 distinct ones to be exact!).
        %h3.article-header= "Use Case"
        %p
          A personal portfolio and blog that allows me to share my work and stories with my community and potential employers. I wanted it to be divided into two main sections. One section where I write project case studies to go through my development and implementation of projects. Another section for blogging where I can write about things I'm interested in and things that I learn.
        %h4 Shopping around
        %p
          Standard profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter, Stack Overflow, Hacker News, Facebook, Instagram, about.me. 
        %h4 Discovering Github pages
        %p 
          Why Github pages is awesome.
        %h3.article-header= "Blogging with Jekyll"
        %p
          First geniune iteration of my site.
          Learning how to use Github Pages.
          How to use a Rails-related application.
          How to publish using the command line.
          Plugins, themes.
        %h4 Drawbacks to Jekyll
        %p Way too much functionality that I didn't need and got in the way.
        %h3.article-header= "Leaving the clutter for D3.js"
        %p
          Jekyll got messy and complicated. Wanted something simple.
        %h3.article-header= "Static site generators take two: Blogging with Octopress"
        %p
          Wanted to see what the fuss was all about. 
        %h3.article-header= "Expanding my awareness by rolling my own"
        %p
          Got tired of how much functionality Octopress had that I ultimately didn't need. Also wanted to fully understand how a static site generator works, so I created my own using Python and Flask.
        %h3.article-header= "Achieving enlightenment with Middleman"
        %p 
          Balance between something simple and something beautifully made.
