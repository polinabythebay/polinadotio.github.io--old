        %p
          A personal portfolio and blog that allows me to share my work and stories with my community and potential employers. I wanted it to be divided into two main sections. One section where I write project case studies to go through my development and implementation of projects. Another section for blogging where I can write about things I'm interested in and things that I learn.
        %p
          First iteration of my site-- Using Jekyll
          https://github.com/polinadotio/psoshnin.github.io--v1
        %p
          Second iteration of my site-- Single page using D3.js 
        %p
          Content loaded from external files

If you load models or textures from external files, due to browsers' "same origin policy" security restrictions, loading from a file system will fail with a security exception.

There are two ways how to solve this:

    Change security for local files in a browser (access page as file:///example)

    Run files from a local server (access page as http://localhost/example)

If you use option 1, be aware that you may open yourself to some vulnerabilities if using the same browser for a regular web surfing. You may want to create a separate browser profile / shortcut used just for local development to be safe.
