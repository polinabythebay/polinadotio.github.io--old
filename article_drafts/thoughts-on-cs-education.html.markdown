What I learned at Wellesley.

All-womens experience

What I lacked:
--time left in college to pursue more internships
--coop experience
--more industry experience

what I gained:




what I was able to learn:

- Programming and Problem Solving: introductory course

abstraction, modularity, problem solving strategies, understand how programs get executed

reading, modifying, debugging, designing, writing, and testing Java programs

- Data structures

data abstraction, modularity, performance analysis, abstract data types (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, tables)

reading, modifying, debugging, designing, writing, and testing Java programs

- Algorithms

design and analysis of fundamental algorithms in computer science

sorting, searching, graph algorithms, file compression, and NP-completeness

work: proofs, problem sets

- Automata

Finite Automata and regular expressions
Context free grammars
Turing machines and decidability
NP complete problems

work: proofs, problem sets

- Computer Systems

digital logic, boolean/bitwise operations
memory addressing 
C, pointers, arrays
procedures, stacks, cpu
memory hierarchy and cache, virtual memory
adders
parallelism and concurrency
