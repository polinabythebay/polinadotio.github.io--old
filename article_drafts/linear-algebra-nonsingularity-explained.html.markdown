Mathematics is a system of objects, operations, and shorthand representations. If it's designed well, then a number of useful, provable properties can follow from math objects, operations, and their organization. These properties can be used to model the things we experience in the real world.

Algebra roughly translates to "relationships". Without knowing the value between two unknown numbers, you can still look at the interesting relationship they have. For example:

(x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2

Linear algebra looks at the relationship between linear relationships. 

Linear algebra turns your math equations into mini spreadsheets.

Linear algebra is designed to represent systems of linear equations. Linear equations are designed to represent linear relationships, where one entity is written to be a sum of multiples of other entities. In the shorthand of linear algebra, a linear relationship is represented as a linear operator — a matrix.


A matrix is a single variable representing a spreadsheet of inputs or operations.

The determinant is the “size” of the output transformation. If the input was a unit vector (representing area or volume of 1), the determinant is the size of the transformed area or volume. A determinant of 0 means matrix is “destructive” and cannot be reversed (similar to multiplying by zero: information was lost).

A square matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is 0.
