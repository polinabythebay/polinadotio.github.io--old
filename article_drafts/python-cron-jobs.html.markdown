Use Case: 
DB monitoring
pulling metrics from a DB as a daily report
Importing/exporting a daily job

1. Set up python virtual env

This creates a lightweight virual environment for working on your cron job. Each virtual environment has its own python binaries and packages unique to its env.

pip install virtualenv

source venv/bin/activate


virtualenv venv
install simplejson requests
./export.py

alright, so currently cannot use that
