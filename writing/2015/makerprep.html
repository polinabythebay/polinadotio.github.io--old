            <div class='article-body'>
              <p>MakerPrep is a part time introduction to web development class hosted by MakerSquare in downtown San Francisco. I wanted to review what we covered in MakerPrep and how I got to taking it.</p>
              
              <p>Prior to taking the course, I had been working at my first job out of college at a startup in downtown San Francisco. My role was to support the development teams and lead the technical implementation of the startup&rsquo;s SDKs for large mobile gaming studios. It was an eventful first year marked by 2 large layoffs that cut the headcount by more than half, a failed Oracle acquisition, a pivot to a brand new platform, and a looming mountain of technical debt. Because I wasn&rsquo;t a part of a specific development team, towards the end I became tasked mostly with trying to fix certain technical debt that was starting to catch on fire. It was really stressful and I wasn&rsquo;t really excited about pouring over ancient obfuscated python code that no current developer there cared about or knew about. Suffice it to say, I wanted to do something else, and I&rsquo;d been developing Rails apps on my own for the better part of a year at that point. </p>
              
              <p>Coming from a technical background, I was looking to find other individuals with similar learning goals to myself. This lead me to attending Javascript study groups at MakerSquare, and enrolling in their part time onsite course.</p>
              
              <h4>Course overview</h4>
              
              <p>The course is taught and curated by a MakerSquare fellow, which is a student who recently completed MakerSquare&rsquo;s 3 month program.</p>
              
              <ul>
              <li>Inaugural cohort (course has changed since then)</li>
              <li>Instructor: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardartoul">Richie Artoul</a></li>
              <li>Duration: 4 weeks, 5 days/week, 6:30-9:30pm each day (~60 hours total)</li>
              <li>Cost: $900</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>What the course covers</h4>
              
              <ul>
              <li>HTML, CSS, Markdown, Forms, Bootstrap</li>
              <li>DOM, Javascript runtime, JSON</li>
              <li>Javascript fundamentals: logic flow, Objects, Functions, Arrays</li>
              <li>Functional programming, Object Oriented programming, Events</li>
              <li>Building single page apps with Firebase, Ajax, and jQuery</li>
              <li>Lecture on hiring/portfolio/next steps.</li>
              <li>1:1 time with the instructor to discuss learning goals.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>The most valuable part of the course was the several days we spent on functional programming in JavaScript. We went through the <a href="http://reactivex.io/learnrx/">LearnRx</a> tutorial, which I <strong>highly</strong> recommend. I had one course in college I took that covered functional programming in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a>, but I never came out of the course with as clear of an understanding of functional programming as I did reimplementing utility methods (reduce, map, filter) from scratch in JavaScript. </p>
              
              <p>The second most valuable part of the course was getting to know other folks who had similar learning goals to mine. It was extremely valuable for me to have that as I was having stressful days at work at the time and spending 3 hours a night working through programming challenges with my fellow students at MakerPrep gave me something to look forward to. </p>
              
              <p>The third most valuable thing I got out of MakerPrep was the confidence and wherewithall to build single page apps using jQuery and Firebase as a backend. Prior to the course I had little experience interacting directly with the DOM (Rails operates on a completely different level) and spending several weeks on this really helped solidify it for me.</p>
              
              <p>A fourth valuable aspect of the course is if you&rsquo;re interested in attending MakerSquare, the course is taught by someone who went through the program and is a great source of knowledge for what the program covered and their experience.</p>
              
              <h4>What the course does not cover</h4>
              
              <p>MakerPrep does not cover everything you need to know to pass an interview at MakerSquare. I&rsquo;ll cover prepping for the MakerSquare interview in a separate post. I think the course does a great job of teaching you web and JavaScript fundamentals that will help you succeed at MakerSquare, but you will need to do additional studying to master topics covered in the interview.</p>
              
              <h4>Alternatives to MakerPrep</h4>
              
              <p>One important thing to know prior to taking MakerPrep is that MakerSquare is a <a href="http://www.hackreactorcore.com/">Hack Reactor Core</a> program member, as is <a href="http://www.telegraphacademy.com/">Telegraph Academy</a> in Oakland, CA. Telegraph Academy offers a prep course for the exact same material taught at MakerSquare and <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>. While all three software accelerators have their own implementations of a prep course, at the end of the day they&rsquo;re trying to achieve the same result. I would recommend checking out the alternatives to see if it would be a better fit for you logistically or geographically.</p>
